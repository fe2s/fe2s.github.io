    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Real-time processing is becoming very popular, and Storm is a popular open source framework and runtime used by Twitter for processing real-time data streams. Storm addresses the complexity of running real time streams through a compute cluster by providing an elegant set of abstractions that make it easier to reason about your problem domain by letting you focus on data flows rather than on implementation details.</p>

<p>Storm has many use cases: realtime analytics, online machine learning, continuous computation, distributed RPC, ETL, and more. Storm is fast: a benchmark clocked it at over a million tuples processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant, guarantees your data will be processed, and is easy to set up and operate.</p>

<p>This pattern integrates XAP with Storm. XAP is used as stream data source and fast reliable persistent storage, whereas Storm is in charge of data processing. We support both pure Storm and Trident framework.</p>

<p>As part of this integration we provide classic <strong>Word Counter</strong> and <strong>Twitter Reach</strong> implementations on top of XAP and Trident.</p>

<p>Also, we demonstrate how to build highly available, scalable equivalent of <strong>Realtime Google Analytics</strong> application with XAP and Storm. Application can be deployed to cloud with one click using Cloudify.</p>

<h1>Storm in a Nutshell</h1>

<p>Storm is a real time, open source data streaming framework that functions entirely in memory.  It constructs a processing graph that feeds data from an input source through processing nodes.  The processing graph is called a &ldquo;topology&rdquo;.  The input data sources are called &ldquo;spouts&rdquo;, and the processing nodes are called &ldquo;bolts&rdquo;.  The data model consists of tuples.  Tuples flow from Spouts to the bolts, which execute user code. Besides simply being locations where data is transformed or accumulated, bolts can also join streams and branch streams.</p>

<p>Storm is designed to be run on several machines to provide parallelism.  Storm topologies are deployed in a manner somewhat similar to a webapp or a XAP processing unit; a jar file is presented to a deployer which distributes it around the cluster where it is loaded and executed.  A topology runs until it is killed.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/storm-nutshell.png" /></p>

<p>Beside Storm, there is a <strong>Trident</strong> – a high-level abstraction for doing realtime computing on top of Storm. Trident adds primitives like groupBy, filter, merge, aggregation to simplify common computation routines. Trident has consistent, exactly-once semantics, so it is easy to reason about Trident topologies.</p>

<p>Capability to guarantee exactly-once semantics comes with additional cost. To guarantee that, incremental processing should be done on top of persistence data source. Trident has to ensure that all updates are idempotent. Usually that leads to lower throughput and higher latency than similar topology with pure Storm.</p>

<h1>Spouts</h1>

<p>Basically, Spouts provide the source of tuples for Storm processing.  For spouts to be maximally performant and reliable, they need to provide tuples in batches, and be able to replay failed batches when necessary.  Of course, in order to have batches, you need storage, and to be able to replay batches, you need reliable storage.  XAP is about the highest performing, reliable source of data out there, so a spout that serves tuples from XAP is a natural combination.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/xap-general-spout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Depending on domain model and level of guarantees you want to provide, you choose either pure Storm or Trident. We provide Spout implementations for both – <code>XAPSimpleSpout</code> and <code>XAPTranscationalTridentSpout</code> respectively.</p>

<h2>Storm Spout</h2>

<p><code>XAPSimpleSpout</code> is a spout implementation for pure Storm that reads data in batches from XAP. On XAP side we introduce conception of stream. Please find <code>SimpleStream</code> – a stream implementation that supports writing data in single and batch modes and reading in batch mode. <code>SimpleStream</code> leverages XAP’s FIFO(First In, First Out) capabilities.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/simple-spout.jpg" /></p>

<p><code>SimpleStream</code> works with arbitrary space class that has <code>FifoSupport.OPERATION</code> annotation and implements <code>Serializable</code>.</p>

<p>Here is an example how one may write data to <code>SimpleStream</code> and process it in Storm topology. Let’s consider we would like to build an application to analyze the stream of page views (user clicks) on website. At first, we create a data model that represents a page view</p>

<pre><code class="java">@SpaceClass(fifoSupport = FifoSupport.OPERATION)
public class PageView implements Serializable {
    private String id;
    private String page;
   private String sessionId;
   [getters setters omitted for brevity]
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now we would like to create a reference to stream instance and write some data.</p>

<pre><code class="java">SimpleStream&lt;PageView&gt; stream = new SimpleStream&lt;&gt;(space, new PageView());
stream.writeBatch(pageViews);
</code></pre>

<p>The second argument of <code>SimpleStream</code> is a template used to match objects during reading.
If you want to have several streams with the same type, template objects should differentiate your streams.</p>

<p>Now let’s create a spout for <code>PageView</code> stream.</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class PageViewSpout extends XAPSimpleSpout&lt;PageView&gt; {
    public PageViewSpout() {
        super(new PageViewTupleConverter(), new PageView());
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To create a spout, we have to specify how we want our space class be converted to Storm tuple. That is exactly what <code>TupleConverter</code> knows about.</p>

<pre><code class="java">class PageViewTupleConverter implements TupleConverter&lt;PageView&gt; {
    @Override
    public Fields tupleFields() {
        return new Fields("page", "session");
    }

    @Override
    public List&lt;Object&gt; spaceObjectToTuple(PageView pageView) {
        return Arrays.&lt;Object&gt;asList(pageView.getPage(), pageView.getSessionId());
    }
}  
</code></pre>

<p>At this point we have everything ready to build Storm topology with <code>PageViewSpout</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="java">Config conf = new Config();
conf.put(ConfigConstants.XAP_SPACE_URL_KEY, "jini://*/*/space");
conf.put(ConfigConstants. XAP_STREAM_BATCH_SIZE, 300);
TopologyBuilder builder = new TopologyBuilder();
builder.setSpout("pageViewSpout", new PageViewSpout());
</code></pre>

<p><code>ConfigConstants.XAP_SPACE_URL_KEY</code> is a space URL</p>

<p><code>ConfigConstants. XAP_STREAM_BATCH_SIZE</code> is a maximum number of items that spout reads from XAP with one hit.</p>

<h2>Trident Spout</h2>

<p><code>XAPTranscationalTridentSpout</code> is a scalable, fault-tolerant, transactional spout for Trident, supports pipelining. Let’s discuss all its properties in details.</p>

<p>For spout to be maximally performant, we want an ability to scale the number of instances to control the parallelism of reader threads.</p>

<p>There are several spout APIs available that we could potentially use for our XAPTranscationalTridentSpout implementation:
- <code>IPartitionedTridentSpout</code>: A transactional spout that reads from a partitioned data source. The problem with this API is that it doesn’t acknowledge when batch is successfully processed which is critical for in memory solutions since we want to remove items from the grid as soon as they have been processed. Another option would be to use XAP’s lease capability to remove items by time out. This might be unsafe, if we keep items too long, we might consume all available memory.   <br/>
- <code>ITridentSpout</code>: The most general API. Setting parallelism hint for this spout to N will create N spout instances, single coordinator and N emitters. When coordinator issues new transaction id, it passes this id to all emitters. Emitter reads its portion of transaction by given transaction id. Merged data from all emitters forms transaction.</p>

<p>For our implementation we choose <code>ITridentSpout</code> API.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/trident-spout.jpg" /></p>

<p>There is one to one mapping between XAP partitions and emitters.</p>

<p>Storm framework guarantees that topology is high available, if some component fails, it restarts it. That means our spout implementation should be stateless or able to recover its state after failure.</p>

<p>When emitter is created, it calls remote service <code>ConsumerRegistryService</code> to register itself. <code>ConsumerRegistryService</code> knows the number of XAP partitions and keeps track of the last allocated partition.  This information is reliably stored in the space, see <code>ConsumerRegistry.java</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/consumer-registry.jpg" /></p>

<p>Remember that parallelism hint for <code>XAPTranscationalTridentSpout</code> should equal to the number of XAP partitions.</p>

<p>The property of being transactional is defined in Trident as following:
- batches for a given txid are always the same. Replays of batches for a txid will exact same set of tuples as the first time that batch was emitted for that txid.
- there’s no overlap between batches of tuples (tuples are in one batch or another, never multiple).
- every tuple is in a batch (no tuples are skipped)</p>

<p><code>XAPTranscationalTridentSpout</code> works with <code>PartitionedStream</code> that wraps stream elements into Item class and keeps items ordered by ‘offset’ property. There is one <code>PartitionStream</code> instance per XAP partition.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/partitioned-stream.jpg" /></p>

<p>Stream’s <code>WriterHead</code> holds the last offset in the stream.  Any time batch of elements (or single element) written to stream, <code>WriterHead</code> incremented by the number of elements. Allocated numbers used to populate offset property of Items. <code>WriterHead</code> object is kept in heap, there is no need to keep it in space. If primary partition fails, <code>WriterHead</code> is reinitialized to be the max offset value for given stream.</p>

<p><code>ReaderHead</code> points to the last read item. We have to keep this value in the space, otherwise if partition fails we won’t be able to infer this value.</p>

<p>When spout request new batch, we take <code>ReaderHead</code>, read data from that point and update <code>ReaderHead</code>. New <code>BatchMetadata</code> object is placed to the space, it keeps start offset and number of items in the batch. In case Storm requests transaction replaying, we are able to reread exactly the same items by given batchId. Finally, once Storm acknowledges that batch successfully processed, we delete <code>BatchMetadata</code> and corresponding items from the space.</p>

<p>By default, Trident processes a single batch at a time, waiting for the batch to succeed or fail before trying another batch. We can get significantly higher throughput  and lower latency of processing of each batch – by pipelining the batches. You configure the maximum amount of batches to be processed simultaneously with the “topology.max.spout.pending” property.</p>

<p>Operations with <code>PartitionedStream</code> are encapsulated in remote service – <code>PartitionedStreamService</code>.</p>

<p>Here is an example how to use <code>XAPTransactionalTridentSpout</code>:</p>

<pre><code class="java">Config conf = new Config();
conf.setMaxSpoutPending(20);
conf.put(ConfigConstants.XAP_SPACE_URL_KEY, "jini://*/*/space?groups=XAPTransactionalTridentSpoutTest-test");
TridentTopology topology = new TridentTopology();
TridentState wordCounts = topology
                .newStream("spout1", spout)
                .each(new Fields("sentence"), new Split(), new Fields("word"))
                .groupBy(new Fields("word"))
                .persistentAggregate(stateFactory, new Count(), new Fields("count")).parallelismHint(16);
</code></pre>

<p>The full example that demonstrates usage of <code>XAPTransactionalTridentSpout</code> to address classic <em>Word Counter</em> problem can be found in <code>XAPTransactionalTridentSpoutTest</code>.</p>

<h1>Trident State</h1>

<p>Trident has first-class abstractions for reading from and writing to stateful sources. Details are available on the <a href="https://storm.incubator.apache.org/documentation/Trident-state">Storm wiki site</a>.</p>

<p>In Trident topology that is persisting state via this mechanism, the overall throughput is almost certainly constrained by the performance of the state persistence.  This is a good place where XAP can step in and provide extremely high performance persistence for stream processing state.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/trident-state.jpg" /></p>

<p>XAP Trident state implementation supports all state types – non-transactional, transactional and opaque.  All you need to create a Trident state is configure space url and choose appropriate factory method of <code>XAPStateFactory</code> class:</p>

<pre><code class="java">Config conf = new Config();
conf.setMaxSpoutPending(20);
conf.put(ConfigConstants.XAP_SPACE_URL_KEY, "jini://*/*/space ");
StateFactory stateFactory = XAPStateFactory.transactional();
TridentState wordCounts = topology
                .newStream("spout1", spout).parallelismHint(16)
                .each(new Fields("sentence"), new Split(), new Fields("word"))
                .groupBy(new Fields("word"))
                .persistentAggregate(stateFactory, new Count(), new Fields("count")).parallelismHint(16);
</code></pre>

<p>The full example can be found in <code>TridentWordCountTest</code>.</p>

<h2>Trident Read-Only state</h2>

<p>Trident Read-Only state allows to lookup persistent data during the computation.</p>

<p>Consider <em>Twitter Reach</em> example. Reach is the number of unique people exposed to a URL on Twitter. To compute reach, you need to fetch all the people who ever tweeted a URL, fetch all the followers of all those people, unique that set of followers, and that count that uniqued set.</p>

<p>XAP is a good candidate to store reference data such as tweeted url and followers. You can easily create XAP read-only state with <code>XAPReadOnlyStateFactory</code>. The following example demonstrates how to create a read-only state for <code>TweeterUrl</code> and <code>Followers</code> classes. The input arguments that Trident pass to <code>stateQuery()</code> are used as space ids.</p>

<p>The full example can be found in <code>TridentReachTest</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="java">TridentState tweetedUrls = topology.newStaticState(XAPReadOnlyStateFactory.byIds(TweetedUrl.class));
TridentState followers = topology.newStaticState(XAPReadOnlyStateFactory.byIds(Followers.class));
        topology.newDRPCStream("reach", drpc)
                .stateQuery(tweetedUrls, new Fields("args"), new MapGet(), new Fields("tweetedUrls"))
                .each(new Fields("tweetedUrls"), new ExpandTweetersList(), new Fields("tweeter"))
                .shuffle()
                .stateQuery(followers, new Fields("tweeter"), new MapGet(), new Fields("followers"))
                .each(new Fields("followers"), new ExpandFollowersList(), new Fields("follower"))
                .groupBy(new Fields("follower"))
                .aggregate(new One(), new Fields("one"))
                .aggregate(new Fields("one"), new Sum(), new Fields("reach"));
</code></pre>

<p>Another option to create XAP read-only state is to use SQL query. In this case <code>stateQuery’s</code> input arguments are used as SQL parameters:</p>

<pre><code class="java">SQLQuery&lt;Person&gt; sqlQuery = new SQLQuery&lt;&gt;(Person.class, "name = ? AND age &gt; 30").setProjections("age");
TridentState state = topology.newStaticState(XAPReadOnlyStateFactory.bySqlQuery(sqlQuery));
</code></pre>

<p>The full example can be found in <code>SqlQueryReadOnlyStateTest</code>.</p>

<h1>Storm bolts</h1>

<p>If pure Storm suits better your needs, most likely you will want to read/write data from bolts to persistent storage. For instance, imagine you are processing stream of data and would like to present computation result on UI. So the final bolt in your topology pipeline should write result to XAP which can then be accessed from anywhere. For this purpose we created <code>XAPAwareRichBolt</code> and <code>XAPAwareBasicBolt</code> that have a reference to space proxy. All you need is to configure space url and extend XAP aware bolt.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class TotalActiveUsersBolt extends XAPAwareBasicBolt {
   public void execute(Tuple tuple, BasicOutputCollector collector) {
        ActiveUsersReport report = … ; // compute     
        space.write(report);
   }
  ….
}
</code></pre>

<h1>Illustrative example: Real-time Google Analytics</h1>

<p>In this section we demonstrate how to build highly available, scalable equivalent of <em>Real-time Google Analytics</em> application and deploy it to cloud with one click using <em>Cloudify</em>.</p>

<p>Real-Time Google Analytics allows you to monitor activity as it happens on your site. The reports are updated continuously and each page view is reported seconds after it occurs on your site. For example, you can see:
- how many people are on your site right now
- dynamic of page views during last minute
- users geographic locations
- traffic sources that referred them
- which pages or events they&rsquo;re interacting with</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/storm-screen-with-browser.jpg" /></p>

<h2>High-level architecture diagram</h2>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/google-analytics-high-level.jpg" /></p>

<p><em>PageView feeder</em> is a standalone java application that simulates users on the site. It continuously sends <code>PageView</code> json to rest service endpoints deployed in XAP web PU. PageView looks like this</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
 “sessionId”:  “sessionid581239234”,
“referral”: “https://www.google.com/#q=gigaspace”,
“page”: “http://www.gigaspaces.com/about”,
“ip”: “89.162.139.2”
}
</code></pre>

<p>Rest service converts JSON documents to space object and writes them to the stream. Stream is consumed by Storm topology which performs all necessary processing in memory and stores results in XAP space. End user is browsing web page hosted in Web PU that continuously updates reports with AJAX requests backed by another rest service. Rest service reads report from XAP space.</p>

<p>We use pure Storm to build topology. There are several reasons why we don’t use Trident for this application. We are tolerant to page views loss if some Storm node fails. We don’t need exactly-once processing semantic. Instead, we want to maximize throughput and minimize latency.</p>

<h2>Google Analytics Topology. High level overview.</h2>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/google-analytics-topology.jpg" /></p>

<p>PageView spout forks five branches, each branch calculates its report and can be scaled independently. The final bolt in the branch writes data to XAP space.  In the next sections we take a closer look at branches design.</p>

<h2>Top urls topology branch</h2>

<p>Top urls report displays top 10 visited urls for the last ten seconds. Topology implements distributed rolling count algorithm. The report is updated every second.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/top-urls.jpg" /></p>

<p>Tuples flow from spout to <code>UrlRollingCountBolt</code> grouped by ‘url’. <code>UrlRollingCountBolt</code> calculates rolling count with sliding windows of 10 seconds for every url. Sliding windows is basically a cyclic buffer with a head pointing to current slot. When bolt receives new tuple, it finds a sliding window for this tuple and increments the number in current slot. Every two seconds <code>UrlRollingCountBolt</code> emits the sum of sliding window for every url, then sliding windows advance and head points to the next slot.</p>

<p>The url and its rolling count flow to <code>IntermediateRankingsBolt</code> which maintains pair of (url, count) in sorted by count order and emits its top 10 urls to the final stage. <code>TotalUrlRankingBolt</code> calculates the global top 10 urls and writes report object to XAP space. The primitives to implement rolling count algorithm can be found in <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-storm/tree/master/examples/storm-starter">storm-starter</a> project.</p>

<p>Top referrals topology branch is identical to top urls one. The only difference in is that we calculate ‘referral’ rather than ‘url’ tuple field.</p>

<h2>Active users topology branch</h2>

<p>Active users report displays how many people on the site right now. We assume that if user hasn’t opened any page for the last N seconds, then user has left the site. Users are uniquely identified by ‘sessionId’ tuple field. For demo purpose N is configured to 5 seconds, though it should be much longer in real life application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/active-users.jpg" /></p>

<p>Tuples flow from spout to <code>PartitionedActiveUsersBolt</code> grouped by ‘sessionId’. For every sessionId  <code>PartitionedActiveUsersBolt</code>  keeps track of the last seen time. Every second it removes sessions seen last time earlier than N seconds before and then emits the number of remaining ones.</p>

<p><code>TotalActiveUsersBolt</code> maintains a map of [source_task, count] and emits the total count for all sources. Report is written to XAP.</p>

<h2>Page view time series topology branch</h2>

<p>Page view time series report displays the dynamic of visited pages for last minute. The chart is updated every second.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/page-views.jpg" /></p>

<p><code>PageViewCountBolt</code> calculates the number of page views and passes local count to <code>PageViewTimeSeriesBolt</code> every second. <code>PageViewTimeSeriesBolt</code> maintains a sliding window counter and writes report to XAP space.</p>

<h2>Geo topology branch</h2>

<p>Geo report displays a map of users’ geographical location. Depending on the volume of traffic from particular country, country is filled with different colors on the map.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-storm/geo.jpg" /></p>

<p>IP address converted to country using <a href="http://dev.maxmind.com/">MaxMind GeoIP database</a>. The database is a binary file loaded into <code>GeoIPBolt’s</code> heap. <code>GeoIpLookupService</code> ensures that it’s loaded only once per JVM.</p>

    <id>http://fe2s.github.io/blog/2014/05/14/xap-kafka</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a> is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system. It is designed to support persistent messaging with a O(1) disk structures that provides constant time performance even with many TB of stored messages. Apache Kafka provides High-throughput even with very modest hardware, Kafka can support hundreds of thousands of messages per second. Apache Kafka supports partitioning the messages over Kafka servers and distributing consumption over a cluster of consumer machines while maintaining per-partition ordering semantics. Many times Apache Kafka is used to perform parallel data load into Hadoop.</p>

<p>This pattern integrates <a href="http://www.gigaspaces.com/">GigaSpaces</a> with Apache Kafka. GigaSpaces’ write-behind IMDG operations to Kafka making it available for the subscribers. Such could be Hadoop or other data warehousing systems using the data for reporting and processing. Sources are available on <a href="https://github.com/fe2s/xap-kafka">github</a></p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>XAP Kafka Integration Architecture</h2>

<p>The XAP Kafka integration is done via the <code>SpaceSynchronizationEndpoint</code> interface deployed as a Mirror service PU. It consumes a batch of IMDG operations, converts them to custom Kafka messages and sends these to the Kafka server using the Kafka Producer API.</p>

<p><img src="/images/xap-kafka/xap-kafka.jpg"  /></p>

<p>GigaSpace-Kafka protocol is simple and represents the data and its IMDG operation. The message consists of the IMDG operation type (Write, Update , remove, etc.) and the actual data object. The Data object itself could be represented either as a single object or as a Space Document with key/values pairs (<code>SpaceDocument</code>).
Since a Kafka message is sent over the wire, it should be serialized to bytes in some way.
The default encoder utilizes Java serialization mechanism which implies Space classes (domain model) to be <code>Serializable</code>.</p>

<p>By default Kafka messages are uniformly distributed across Kafka partitions. Please note, even though IMDG operations appear ordered in <code>SpaceSynchronizationEndpoint</code>, it doesn&rsquo;t imply correct ordering of data processing in Kafka consumers. See below diagram:</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<h3>Download the Kafka Example</h3>

<p>You can download the example code from <a href="https://github.com/fe2s/xap-kafka">github</a>.
The example located under <code>&lt;project_root&gt;/example</code>. It demonstrates how to configure Kafka persistence and implements a simple Kafka consumer pulling data from Kafka and store in HsqlDB.</p>

<h3>Running the Example</h3>

<p>In order to run an example, please follow the instruction below:</p>

<p>Step 1: Install Kafka<br/></p>

<p>Step 2: Start Zookeeper and Kafka server
<code>sh
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
bin/kafka-list-topic.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181
</code></p>

<p>Step 3: Build project
<code>sh
cd &lt;project_root&gt;
mvn clean install
</code></p>

<p>Step 4: Deploy example to GigaSpaces
<code>
cd example
mvn os:deploy
</code></p>

<p>Step 5: Check GigaSpaces log files, there should be messages from the Feeder and Consumer.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<h3>Library Dependency</h3>

<p>The following maven dependency needs to be included in your project in order to use Kafka persistence. This artifact is built from <code>&lt;project_rood&gt;/kafka-persistence</code> source directory.</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;com.epam&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;kafka-persistence&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;1.0-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Mirror service</h2>

<p>Here is an example of the Kafka Space Synchronization Endpoint configuration:</p>

<p>&#8220;`xml
<bean id="kafkaSpaceSynchronizationEndpoint" class="com.epam.openspaces.persistency.kafka.KafkaSpaceSynchronizationEndpointFactoryBean">
    <property name="producerProperties">
        <props>
            <prop key="metadata.broker.list"> localhost:9092</prop>
            <prop key="request.required.acks">1</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean></p>

<!--
    The mirror space. Uses the Kafka external data source. Persists changes done on the Space that
    connects to this mirror space into the Kafka.
-->


<p>&lt;os-core:mirror id=&ldquo;mirror&rdquo; url=&ldquo;/./mirror-service&rdquo; space-sync-endpoint=&ldquo;kafkaSpaceSynchronizationEndpoint&rdquo; operation-grouping=&ldquo;group-by-replication-bulk&rdquo;>
    &lt;os-core:source-space name=&ldquo;space&rdquo; partitions=&ldquo;2&rdquo; backups=&ldquo;1&rdquo;/>
&lt;/os-core:mirror>
&#8220;`</p>

<p>Please consult Kafka documentation for the full list of available producer properties.
You can override the default properties if there is a need to customize GigaSpace-Kafka protocol. See Customization section below for details.</p>

<h3>Space class</h3>

<p>In order to associate a Kafka topic with the domain model class, the class needs to be annotated with the <code>@KafkaTopic</code> annotation and declared as <code>Serializable</code>. Here is an example</p>

<pre><code class="java">@KafkaTopic("user_activity")
@SpaceClass
public class UserActivity implements Serializable {
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<h3>Space Documents</h3>

<p>To configure a Kafka topic for a SpaceDocuments or Extended SpaceDocument, the property <code>KafkaPersistenceConstants.SPACE_DOCUMENT_KAFKA_TOPIC_PROPERTY_NAME</code> should be added to document. Here is an example</p>

<pre><code class="java">public class Product extends SpaceDocument {

public Product() {
    super("Product");
    super.setProperty(SPACE_DOCUMENT_KAFKA_TOPIC_PROPERTY_NAME, "product");
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&rsquo;s also possible to configure the name of the property which defines the Kafka topic for SpaceDocuments. Set <code>spaceDocumentKafkaTopicName</code> to the desired value as shown below.</p>

<pre><code class="xml">&lt;bean id="kafkaSpaceSynchronizationEndpoint" class="com.epam.openspaces.persistency.kafka.KafkaSpaceSynchrspaceDocumentKafkaTopicNameonizationEndpointFactoryBean"&gt;
    ...
    &lt;property name="spaceDocumentKafkaTopicName" value="topic_name" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<h2>Kafka consumers</h2>

<p>The Kafka persistence library provides a wrapper around the native Kafka Consumer API for the GigaSpace-Kafka protocol serialization. Please see <code>com.epam.openspaces.persistency.kafka.consumer.KafkaConsumer</code>, example of how to use it under <code>&lt;project_root&gt;/example module</code>.</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<ul>
<li>Kafka persistence was designed to be extensible and customizable.</li>
<li>If you need to create a custom protocol between GigaSpace and Kafka, provide an implementation of <code>AbstractKafkaMessage</code>, <code>AbstractKafkaMessageKey</code>, <code>AbstractKafkaMessageFactory</code>.</li>
<li>If you would like to customize how data grid operations are sent to Kafka or how the Kafka topic is chosen for a given entity, provide an implementation of &lsquo;AbstractKafkaSpaceSynchronizationEndpoint&rsquo;.</li>
<li>If you want to create a custom serializer, look at <code>KafkaMessageDecoder</code> and <code>KafkaMessageKeyDecoder</code>.</li>
<li>Kafka Producer client (which is used under the hood) can be configured with a number of settings, see Kafka documentation.</li>
</ul>
