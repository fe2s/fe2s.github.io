    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>An idea of feature I would love to see in code review and diff/merge tools.</p>

<p>Consider you are reviewing code changes or making 3-way merge where among various things a name of some method has changed. Personally I don’t want to go through tens of files and check that all usages of method changed accordingly.</p>

<p>I would like to see it in more declarative way. One phrase saying ‘method <code>Foo.bar()</code> has changed to <code>Foo.bar2()</code>’ would be enough. Imagine you could accept this particular change and now tool ignores it making the whole picture clearer.</p>

<p>Say for  static object-oriented languages I can imagine a number of refactoring types  where this could be useful - method extract, all kind of renames, replacing inheritance with delegation, replacing constructor with factory methods and so on.</p>

<p>How difficult would it be to implement semantic aware diff on top of Intellij IDEA ?</p>
